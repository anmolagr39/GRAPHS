This bar chart illustrates the Profit After Tax (PAT) for ACC, measured in Crores of Indian Rupees (₹), over a span of five fiscal years from 2018 to 2023. In 2018, the PAT stood at ₹1,006 crore. It increased to ₹1,359 crore in 2019 but then experienced a slight dip to ₹1,415 crore in 2020. The company witnessed a significant rise in PAT, reaching ₹1,820 crore in 2021. However, the most notable observation is the sharp decline in PAT to ₹870 crore in the fiscal year 2022-23.
Overall Summary: ACC's profitability, as reflected by its PAT, shows a volatile trend. While it achieved its peak in 2021, the following year witnessed a significant contraction in profit. This decline, despite a likely increase in revenue (as suggested by other data points), highlights a squeezed bottom line. The reduced profitability is likely due to a combination of factors including the sharp decline in EBITDA margins, potentially higher tax outlays in the 2022-23 fiscal year, or non-operational, extraordinary expenses. A comprehensive analysis of ACC's financial performance in 2022-23, compared against industry benchmarks and considering the prevailing economic climate, is essential to fully understand this profit downturn and assess its potential implications for the future.
