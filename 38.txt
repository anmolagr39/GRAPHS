This bar chart depicts the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) margin for ACC's ready-mix concrete segment as a percentage (%) from 2018 to 2023. Both 2018 and 2019 saw a 10% EBITDA margin. However, the margin experienced a sharp decline to 6% in 2020. While it recovered slightly to 8% in 2021, the year 2022-23 marked a further decrease, with the margin falling to 5%.
Overall Summary: The EBITDA margin of ACC's ready-mix concrete segment shows a concerning downward trend. The initial stable margin of 10% in 2018-2019 was followed by a sharp decline, indicating a weakening of profitability. While a minor recovery occurred in 2021, the further decline to 5% in 2022-23 suggests ongoing challenges in maintaining profitability. This decrease in margin, despite potential growth in sales volume during the same year, indicates a squeeze on profit margins. This could be attributed to increasing input costs, pricing pressure due to competition, or internal operational inefficiencies. ACC needs to investigate these factors further to address this declining profitability trend in its ready-mix concrete segment.
