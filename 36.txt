This bar chart presents the sales volume of ready-mix concrete, measured in million cubic meters, for ACC over a five-year period from 2018 to 2023. In 2018, the volume stood at 3.2 million cubic meters, followed by an increase to 3.5 million cubic meters in 2019. However, the volume declined to 2.3 million cubic meters in 2020 before recovering slightly to 2.8 million cubic meters in 2021. The most significant observation is the substantial growth in ready-mix concrete volume in 2022-23, reaching 3.9 million cubic meters.
Overall Summary: ACC's ready-mix concrete sales volume exhibited fluctuations between 2018 and 2021, with a decline in 2020 potentially influenced by factors like economic slowdown or pandemic-related disruptions. However, the sharp rise to 3.9 million cubic meters in 2022-23 indicates a positive trend. This could be due to increased infrastructure projects, a shift towards utilizing ready-mix concrete for faster construction, or ACC successfully capturing a larger market share. This growth in ready-mix concrete, coupled with potential growth in cement sales, suggests a positive outlook for ACC, particularly in the construction sector. However, external factors like regulatory changes and economic conditions should be monitored for a comprehensive assessment.
