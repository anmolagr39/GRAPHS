The bar chart depicts the Profit Before Tax (PBT) of ACC, in Crores of Indian Rupees (₹), over a five-year period from 2018 to 2023. Starting at ₹1,494 crore in 2018, the PBT shows a significant improvement, reaching ₹2,031 crore in 2019. However, it experiences a decline in 2020, dropping to ₹1,688 crore. The company's PBT then sees a remarkable recovery, reaching its peak at ₹2,460 crore in 2021. Notably, 2022-23 witnesses a sharp decrease in profitability, with PBT plummeting to ₹1,182 crore.
Overall Summary: ACC demonstrated a fluctuating but generally positive profit trend from 2018 to 2021. The decline in 2020 could be attributed to economic factors or internal company adjustments. However, the strong recovery in 2021 showcased resilience and effective strategic decisions. The sharp decline in PBT in 2022-23, despite potential revenue growth and even considering the decline in EBITDA margins across segments, raises concerns. This suggests potential one-time expenses, increased financial costs, or significant tax liabilities. A detailed investigation into these factors, combined with a comparison against industry trends, is crucial to assess the sustainability of ACC's profitability in the long term.
