The bar chart illustrates the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) of ACC, measured in Crores of Indian Rupees (₹), over a span of five fiscal years from 2018 to 2023. Starting at ₹2,183 crore in 2018, the EBITDA exhibits an upward trajectory, reaching ₹2,721 crore in 2019. However, the growth stagnates with a marginal decline to ₹2,556 crore in 2020. This is followed by a notable increase in 2021, reaching ₹3,205 crore. Surprisingly, the EBITDA in 2022-23 experiences a sharp dip, falling to ₹2,256 crore, marking a level lower than that of 2019.
Overall Summary: While ACC demonstrated initial growth in EBITDA from 2018 to 2021, the sharp decline in 2022-23 raises concerns. This decline, despite potentially higher revenues in the same year, suggests a significant squeeze in profitability. This could be due to factors like increased operating costs, higher depreciation, or one-time expenses. A thorough investigation into these factors is essential. Additionally, comparing this data with industry benchmarks and considering any external economic factors will provide a more comprehensive understanding of ACC's financial performance.
