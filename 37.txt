This bar chart shows the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) for ACC's ready-mix concrete segment, measured in Crores of Indian Rupees (₹), over a five-year period from 2018 to 2023. In 2018, the EBITDA was ₹134 crore, which saw a considerable increase to ₹153 crore in 2019. However, 2020 witnessed a sharp decline with EBITDA dropping to ₹60 crore. The segment then experienced some recovery with EBITDA reaching ₹99 crore in 2021 and remaining at the same level of ₹99 crore in 2022-23.
Overall Summary: The EBITDA performance of ACC's ready-mix concrete segment reflects fluctuations and potential challenges. While the segment experienced initial growth in profitability in 2019, the sharp decline in 2020 suggests a significant impact from factors like economic slowdown, project delays, or changes in the competitive landscape. While the segment recovered in subsequent years, the stagnation at ₹99 crore in both 2021 and 2022-23, despite a potential increase in sales volume in 2022-23, raises questions about profitability margins. This could be due to rising input costs, competitive pressures, or a need for operational improvements within the ready-mix concrete segment. Further analysis considering market dynamics, competitor performance, and cost structures is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of these trends.
