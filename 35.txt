The bar graph illustrates ACC's EBITDA margin for its cement segment specifically, represented as a percentage (%), spanning five fiscal years from 2018 to 2023. In 2018, the margin stood at 15%, and it progressively increased to 18% in 2019 and 20% in 2020. This growth culminated in a peak of 21% in 2021. However, a significant decline is observed in the fiscal year 2022-23, with the cement EBITDA margin plunging to 11%.
Overall Summary: ACC's cement segment witnessed a period of healthy profitability between 2018 and 2021, marked by a consistent improvement in its EBITDA margin. Reaching 21% in 2021 indicated efficient cost management and strong pricing power. However, the drastic drop to 11% in 2022-23 raises serious concerns about the segment's profitability. This decline, despite potential growth in sales volume during the same period, suggests a significant squeeze in profit margins. This could be due to increased input costs (like coal, energy, or logistics), heightened competition leading to price pressure, or one-time expenses impacting the segment's profitability. A detailed analysis of these cost factors, along with an assessment of the competitive landscape and industry trends, is essential to understand the driving forces behind this margin compression.
