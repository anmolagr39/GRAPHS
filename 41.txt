It increased to ₹72 in 2019, indicating growth in earnings relative to the number of outstanding shares. This upward trend continued, reaching ₹75 in 2020.

Overall Summary: ACC demonstrated a positive trajectory in earnings per share from 2018 to 2021, indicating increasing profitability and value creation for its shareholders. This consistent growth suggests successful business operations and favorable market conditions. However, the sharp drop to ₹46 in 2022-23 raises concerns. This decline, aligning with the trend observed in Profit After Tax (PAT), suggests a significant contraction in profitability on a per-share basis. Factors contributing to this decline could include the previously mentioned declining EBITDA margins, potential one-time expenses, or a change in the company's capital structure (e.g., an increase in the number of outstanding shares). A thorough analysis of ACC's financial statements and a comparison with industry performance is necessary to assess the implications of this decline for investors.
