This bar chart illustrates the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) specifically from ACC's cement segment in Crores of Indian Rupees (₹) over a five-year period (2018-2023). Starting at ₹2,049 crore in 2018, the cement EBITDA witnessed a growth to ₹2,568 crore in 2019. This upward trajectory continued, though at a slower pace, reaching ₹2,496 crore in 2020 and peaking at ₹3,106 crore in 2021. However, the year 2022-23 saw a dramatic decline, with cement EBITDA plummeting to ₹2,157 crore.
Overall Summary: ACC's cement segment experienced positive growth in EBITDA from 2018 to 2021, indicating increasing profitability. However, the sharp decline in 2022-23 is concerning. While the company experienced a significant increase in cement sales volume during the same period, the drop in EBITDA suggests a considerable decline in profitability per unit of cement sold. This could be due to factors such as rising input costs (like coal and energy), increased competition leading to price pressure, or one-time expenses impacting the segment's profitability. Further investigation into these factors, combined with industry analysis, would provide a clearer understanding of this downturn.
